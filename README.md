Ideal Gas simulation

I simulate an ideal gas and observe how its macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic time
evolution. 

I implement a very simple molecular dynamics engine of hard-sphere particles
bouncing around inside a box. With this engine, I demonstrate that particle speeds approach a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
